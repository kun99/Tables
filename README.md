# Mobile App Dev Project 1

A Tale of Two Tables

## Why this app?

- Needed a convenient way to keep track of homeworks other than using a notepad
- Also needed a convenient way to keep track of my subscriptions to get a better idea how much I was losing monthly
- I used to use a notepad to write down all my homeworks/exams/quizzes but this was a pain to maintain and to use
- Annoying to erase out past homeworks
- Difficult to get a quick view of what homeworks I have
- I also had no idea how much money I was losing to my subscriptions


## How does this app address the painpoints?

- It is more organized and easier to check up on what homeworks I have in a glance
- Sortable by due date
- There is also a notepad in case I want to write something
- Subscriptions page also displays the total sum of money being used for subscriptions
- Easier to maintain as everything is organized in a table
